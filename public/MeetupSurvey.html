<p class="textParagraphMobile">Do you know about conversational commerce? And Messaging as a Platform (MaaP)?</p>

<p class="textParagraphMobile">You should, they are new trends and they are here to stay.</p>

<p class="textParagraphMobile">In short, people just prefer chat: already there, custom attention, immediacy, easier interface... Just think of this:</p>

<ul class="textParagraphMobile">
<li>My nephews (teenagers) love texting, but computers are for old people...</li>
<li>My generation (in my thirties) can use everything, but we want things now and we are getting tired of websites and apps...</li>
<li>My mother (in her seventies), is still scared by a computer, but she usually texts me on WhatsApp...</li>
</ul>

<p class="textParagraphMobile">We might be going to another .com moment, but .chat this time and much wider!</p>

<p class="textParagraphMobile">Currently, I am researching a new concept within these two areas. I would like to learn your insights as expert digital marketer or online business owner, through this survey (choose yours):</p>
